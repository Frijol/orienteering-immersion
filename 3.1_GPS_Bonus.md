## Bonus Tips for GPS import

### Dense features in OOM

Because I overzealously mapped all of the single trees, you can see that my little green X feature overlap each other, so it's pretty hard to see/select the features.

Open Orienteering Mapper lets you make your features smaller, which greatly improves this situation.

### Exporting as GPX

You actually can export GPX waypoints from GPS Essentials if you would prefer to. I tried it both ways and didn't find it substantially different.

Here's how:

In your app (GPS Essentials > Waypoints), go to the Export page:

On the blue bar at the top, it says "KML":

Tap that to open a menu that lets you change your export format:

Select your preferred format and send as before.
