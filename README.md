## Instructions

### Take a selfie
And save it somewhere on your computer where you can find it again.
### Create a new map in Open Orienteering Mapper [[This page in the manual]](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/new_map.html):

Click "Create a new map..." in the upper left under **Activities**.

Leave the default scale of 1:10000, but **–important!–** change the Symbol Set to "**ISOM2000_10000**". Then click **Create**.

Tada! Now you have a brand new mapping canvas to work with.

### Load your face as a template [[This page in the manual]](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/templates.html):

Go to Templates > "Open template..." and find your selfie.

Open Orienteering Mapper gives us some options to set up scale, but we're not too worried about it for this project. Let's just say 1 meter per pixel.

Once you click "Open", your image should show up in the background for your map. Here's mine:

### Start mapping!

The idea is to use the line, point, and area symbols to trace/paint your image.

#### Drawing basics

In general, you will start by selecting a symbol from the palette on the right:

![screen shot 2017-12-22 at 2 28 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454690/34314053-f1449576-e724-11e7-94dd-db9f8ce0e05c.png)

Each symbol is a line, area, or point symbol. Once you've selected a symbol, the drawing tools that make sense will be clickable. For example, when I choose a point feature, I can only use the "set point" tool (the dot):

But when I choose a line or area feature, I can make a spline, circle, square, or freehand drawing:

If I want to make a complex shape, one option is to make a basic shape like a circle, then click the white "edit" arrow to adjust the shape:

![screen shot 2017-12-22 at 2 32 13 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454690/34314054-f15ec52c-e724-11e7-89b3-27e64d58ad3d.png)

Another way to make a complex shape is to select the "draw paths" tool and click many points to draw an outline. Double click when you're finished with the line.

Keep going to make a detailed self portrait!

#### Getting really good at this
My number one piece of advice is to click around and see what happens!

The second piece of advice is to read the manual as mentioned in the "Tools reference" section below.

You should be able to make a pretty good self-portrait just by using the Drawing basics outlined above. But for a really amazing portrait, here are some things you might look for:

* Fill bounded areas
* Fill/create border
* Switch dash direction
* Connect path
* Unify areas
* Cut free form hole
* Convert to curves
* Cut away from area
* Merge area holes

You can find all of these functions in the [Toolbars](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/toolbars.html) manual page.

### Tools reference

Your best source of information is the [Open Orienteering Mapper Manual](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/)! This is *the* source of information about how the software works. But below, I'll point you to a few specific pages and tools that are particularly handy.

#### The Template menu
When you opened your template, a menu popped up below the symbols:

![screen shot 2017-12-22 at 12 10 32 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454690/34311220-3685a45e-e711-11e7-82b7-41c4aa7e9886.png)

As you map, it will be very useful to adjust the opacity and visibility of your map (the painting you're making) and your template (your selfie image).

Learn more about templates on [the template manual page](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/templates.html).

#### Drawing Toolbar
Read the [Manual Page](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/toolbars.html#drawing-toolbar) on the drawing toolbar to understand all the buttons at the top of the screen.

The Tools Menu also shows descriptions of those tools:
