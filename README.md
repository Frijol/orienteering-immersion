Let's just say 1 meter per pixel. </p><p>![screen shot 2017-12-22 at 12 00 10 pm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/454690/34311038-b7f2520a-e70f-11e7-9923-04083755888f.png)</p><p>Once you click "Open", your image should show up in the background for your map.

1. Start mapping! The idea is to use the line, point, and area symbols to trace/paint your image.

## Mapping Tool Tips
Your best source of information is the [Open Orienteering Mapper Manual](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/)! This is *the* source of information about how the software works. But below, I'll point you to a few specific pages and tools that are particularly handy.

### The Template menu
When you opened your template, a menu popped up below the symbols:

As you map, it will be very useful to adjust the opacity and visibility of your map (the painting you're making) and your template (your selfie image).

Learn more about templates on [the template manual page](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/templates.html).

### Drawing Toolbar
Read the [Manual Page](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/toolbars.html#drawing-toolbar) on the drawing toolbar to understand all the buttons at the top of the screen.

The Tools Menu also shows descriptions of those tools:
