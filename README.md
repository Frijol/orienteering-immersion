# Tutorials for modern cartography

[See as Gitbook](https://frijol.gitbooks.io/orienteering-software-tutorials/content/) | [See in Github](https://github.com/Frijol/orienteering-immersion)

These tutorials introduce the basics of map creation using free software, internet-available resources, and fieldwork using smartphones for georeferencing.

Target software is Open Orienteering Mapper; other key tools include Runkeeper, Open Street Map, and GPS Basics.

## Get started:

Go to the [Gitbook version of this page](https://frijol.gitbooks.io/orienteering-software-tutorials/content/) *(if you're not already there– the URL should start with frijol.gitbooks.io)*.

Select a lesson from the left sidebar menu, or press the right arrow on your keyboard to begin with the first lesson.

*Tutorials are ideally completed in order, but it should still work to skip around and/or to do only the top-level content– e.g. [0. Map Your Face] and then immediately [1. Mapping Trails with Runkeeper] (skipping steps 0.5 and 0.9).*
