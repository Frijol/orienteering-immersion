## Instructions

And save it somewhere on your computer where you can find it again.
### Create a new map in Open Orienteering Mapper [[This page in the manual]](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/new_map.html):

The application might be called "Mapper" or "Open Orienteering Mapper" on your computer.

Click "Create a new map..." in the upper left under **Activities**.

Leave the default scale of 1:10000, but **–important!–** change the Symbol Set to "**ISOM2000_10000**". Then click **Create**.

Tada! Now you have a brand new mapping canvas to work with.

Open Orienteering Mapper gives us some options to set up scale, but we're not too worried about it for this project. Let's just say 1 meter per pixel.

Once you click "Open", your image should show up in the background for your map. Here's mine:

### Start mapping!

The idea is to use the line, point, and area symbols to trace/paint your image.

#### Drawing basics

In general, you will start by selecting a symbol from the palette on the right:

Each symbol is a line, area, or point symbol. Once you've selected a symbol, the drawing tools that make sense will be clickable. For example, when I choose a point feature, I can only use the "set point" tool (the dot):

But when I choose a line or area feature, I can make a spline, circle, square, or freehand drawing:

If I want to make a complex shape, one option is to make a basic shape like a circle, then click the white "edit" arrow to adjust the shape:

Another way to make a complex shape is to select the "draw paths" tool and click many points to draw an outline. Double click when you're finished with the line.

Keep going to make a detailed self portrait!
