# Tracing Features from Satellite Imagery – Coming Soon!

Depending on your terrain, satellite imagery can provide excellent source material for adding features to your map before you go out and do fieldwork. You can find the edges of vegetation features, bodies of water, roads, trails, etc.

This tutorial will help you source satellite imagery and import it as a georeferenced template into Open Orienteering Mapper.

## Teach Yourself

In the meanwhile, here is the [Open Orienteering Mapper Manual page on Templates](http://www.openorienteering.org/mapper-manual/pages/templates-index.html).

## See My Approach

You are also welcome to see what I'm working on in the "[sat](https://github.com/Frijol/orienteering-immersion/tree/sat)" branch of my repo, specifically [this file using Geolocator](https://github.com/Frijol/orienteering-immersion/blob/sat/2_Google_Maps_Template.md) and [this one exploring USGS data](https://github.com/Frijol/orienteering-immersion/blob/sat/2_Satellite.md)– but be warned that these pages are incomplete.

My Holy Grail here is to source up-to-date images that come with georeferencing data, such that I don't have to do any manual (and potentially wonky) template adjustment in Open Orienteering Mapper. I don't know yet if this is possible.
