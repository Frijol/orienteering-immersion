## Easy wins from the basemap tutorial

Now that we can visually position templates onto a georeferenced map, what else can we do?

GeoLocator offers an "OCM" option– look, contours that can be traced!

If we have access to some newer or more detailed data, we could also add that, assuming we knew the scale in meters per pixel.

Finally, because this is all georeferenced, it can be used in conjunction with the fieldwork tutorials on this site. It's easier to map when you have something to start with– get out there and use your basemap!
